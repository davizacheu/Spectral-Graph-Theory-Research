Question:

If G has min deg = 2, and G is not regular or biregular then G does not have a NB matrix
(or K matrix) cospectral mate. 

The Laplacian matrix
L = D - A 
Normalized L = D^(-1/2) LD^(-1/2) = I - D^(-1/2)AD^(-1/2) ~ I - D^(-1)A

Question:
If a graph has an equitable partition, can we still create some sort of equality involving B or K
Q is the adjacency matrix for the condensed graph (weighted edges)
